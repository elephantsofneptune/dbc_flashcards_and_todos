This repo includes 4 challenges that represent the design and development of intermediate Ruby applications

Part 1: Ruby Flashcards 1 single deck:  build a game to test yourself and your pair
Part 2: Ruby Flashcards 2 MVC pattern:  improve the design
Part 3: Ruby Todos 1 core features: build a simple todo application with flat-file persistence
Part 4: Ruby Todos 2 additional features:  build additional features

As you're building these applications, consider the resources available to you including books like [POODR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/edpy25pwtfyeckb/Practical%20Object%20Oriented%20Design%20in%20Ruby.pdf), websites like [sourcemaking](http://sourcemaking.com) that includes a tremendous amount of content around design patterns and refactoring, and the insights you and your peers have had over the past days.

How often are you walking around and sharing your ideas with other members of your cohort?  Are you asking each other to share your designs?

How often do you find yourself in the middle of your implementation and realize that something is wrong and you could've done things better if you'd done them differently?  Do you rebuild the application again?

The approach we're using to build our first few applications is the following 5-step process:

1. feature-level design (quick)
2. object-level design (quick)
3. fully tested minimum viable product (slow)
4. review 3-5 other solutions to the same problem (quick)
5. rebuild (slow)

Other solutions can be alumni solutions or they can be those of your peers or the cohort(s) ahead of you.  Take the risk and ask someone to walk you through their code.  You'll both benefit.
